# phoion - An app for organising the photos on your mobile device

This is a prototype that was developed for a project semester in the Master 'International Media and Computing' at the HTW Berlin.
The app uses TensorFlow and MobileNet to classify all pictures the user has on their mobile phone and tags them. The user is also able to add or remove tags. With these tags the user is able to search through their pictures or group them. On the other hand the app offers a feature with which you can find duplicates and similar pictures. Those can be directyl compared to decide which ones you want to keep and which to delete.
